# Chessbot-Ai
ChessBot-AI is a modular, extensible chess engine built in Python with Pygame.
The project is designed with clear architectural separation between game logic, rendering, players (human + AI), and assets, making it a solid foundation for implementing search-based chess AI.
The current version supports full human–vs–human gameplay with move validation, special rules, graphical UI, and a replay/history system. AI support is under active development.
